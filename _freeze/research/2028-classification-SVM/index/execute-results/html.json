An accurate classification of mass spectrometry is a crucial point to establish a reliable diagnosis and decision process regarding a type of cancer.\n\nA statistical methodology for classifying mass spectrometry data is proposed. An overview of wavelets, principal component analysis-T2 statistic, and support vector machines is given. The study is performed on low-mass SELDI spectra derived from patients with breast cancer and from normal controls. There are 156 samples where control (normal) patients contribute with 57 samples and 99 samples are cancer. A hyperparameter optimization is conducted to select a support vector machine classification model based on grid search. The performance was evaluated with a k-fold cross validation technique and Monte-Carlo simulation with 100 replications. The average accuracy is 100% with standard error equals to 0. The averages of the sensitivity and specificity are both equal to 100%, as well as the area under the curve. The excellent performance of the proposed method is mainly due to the modeling, the new PCA-T2 statistic combining details and approximation coefficients, and the feature extraction procedure proposed [@cohen2018new].\n\n",
