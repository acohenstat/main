About a year ago, I wrote my first ever blog post ~ about blogging ~ and tbh, I was really hoping to have published a few more posts by now...but here we are, talking again about why blogging is a valuable way to spend your time and feeling a little sad that I haven't done more by now.

I. Adding a blog to your personal Quarto website

Our Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) students created the bones of their Quarto websites a few months ago, and more recently took a little dive into website customization using Sass & CSS. For anyone who's looking to get started on their website-building journey, feel free to explore the following resources:

`r fontawesome::fa("window-maximize", fill = "#64605f", a11y = "sem")` [Creating your personal website using Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)

`r fontawesome::fa("palette", fill = "#64605f", a11y = "sem")` [Customizing Quarto Websites: Make your website stand out using Sass & CSS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide)

If you've spent some time poking around the official [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/), you may have noticed instructions for creating either a [**Website**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) or a [**Blog**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) -- but what's the difference? Not much, aside from the initial structure of your website:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-website-blog
#| fig-cap: "Quarto websites vs. blogs"
#| fig-subcap: 
#| - "A Quarto 'Website'"
#| - "A Quarto 'Blog'"
#| column: page 
#| layout-nrow: 2
knitr::include_graphics("media/website.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/blog.png")
```
