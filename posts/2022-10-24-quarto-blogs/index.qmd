About a year ago, I wrote my first ever blog post ~ about blogging ~ and tbh I'm a *little* embarrassed that this is only my third post here (does it count that I have *ideas* for blog posts squirreled away at least?? `r fontawesome::fa("grin-beam-sweat", fill = "#64605f", a11y = "sem")`). Regardless, you should trust me when I say that blogging is a great exercise for you (to learn a new skill, to expand your professional portfolio/online profile, to connect with others) to practice as regularly as you can. Rather than repeat content here, take a peek at my [first post](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2021-09-21-distill-blogs/), which touches on why you should blog and some ideas on how to structure your blog posts.

## I. Preface

Our Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) students created the bones of their Quarto websites a few months ago, and more recently took a little dive into website customization using Sass & CSS. For anyone who's looking to get started on their website-building journey, feel free to explore the following resources:

`r fontawesome::fa("window-maximize", fill = "#64605f", a11y = "sem")` [Creating your personal website using Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)

`r fontawesome::fa("palette", fill = "#64605f", a11y = "sem")` [Customizing Quarto Websites: Make your website stand out using Sass & CSS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide)

## II. What's the difference between a website and a blog?

If you've spent some time poking around the official [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/), you may have noticed instructions for creating either a [**Website**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) or a [**Blog**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) -- but what's the difference? Not much, aside from the initial structure:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
#| fig-subcap: 
#| - "When you create a new Quarto website, it'll look like this (it has a traditional landing (i.e. 'Home') page and no incorporated blog)..."
#| - "... while a new Quarto blog will look like this (with a listing page as your landing page)"
knitr::include_graphics("media/website.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/blog.png")
```

A Quarto Blog is *a type* of Quarto Website -- according to the Quarto documentation, you can create websites that consist of just a single blog (like the above right-hand example), websites that have multiple blogs, or you can add a blog to a website that contains other content (which is what we'll be doing today).

Let's get started.

## III. Adding a blog to your personal Quarto website

1. **Create a `posts` directory:** Open up your Quarto website project (I find it easiest to do this in RStudio) and make sure you're in your root directory. Here, we'll create a new subdirectory, called `posts`, where all of our blog posts will eventually live. To do so, you can either (a) click on the **add folder** button, <img src="media/add-folder.png" alt="" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 2px; width:20px;height:20px;"/>, in the files pane, or (b) in the RStudio Terminal, run `mkdir posts`.

2. ***Optional:* Add a `_metadata.yml` file to `posts`:** While not required, a `_metadata.yml` file can make your life easier if you want certain options to apply to all blog posts that you create. In the RStudio Terminal, run `cd posts` to move into that directory, then `touch _metadata.yml` to create the file. Open your new file in the source pane to add options. I suggest starting with this: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# options specified here will apply to all posts in this folder

# freeze computational output (see https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze)
freeze: true

# Enable banner style title blocks (see https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/title-blocks.html)
title-block-banner: true
```

3. **Create a [listing page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html):** A listing page is a page with content that is automatically generated from a list of documents -- in this case, that would be a list of blog posts -- and looks something like this (or check out my blog's listing page [here](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts.html)):

<center><img src="media/listing-page.png"  alt="" width="500"></center>
<center><p class="gray-italic">The [MEDS Community Blog](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/blog.html) listing page</p></center>

- To create a listing page, add a `posts.qmd` file to your *root* directory. First, click on the R Project icon, <img src="media/rproj.png" alt="" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 2px; width:20px;height:20px;"/>, to jump back to your project's root directory. There are a bunch of ways to create a new `.qmd` file, but one easy way is to choose *File* > *New File* > *Quarto Document...*. Here, I give mine the title "My Blog" when prompted, then saved it as `posts.qmd` (but you can choose whatever title and/or file name you'd like).

4. **Configure your listing page:** Update the YAML section of `posts.qmd`. There are a variety of options that you can specify. Below are just a few, but check out other options [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html):

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
title: "My Blog"
listing: 
  contents: posts # includes all Quarto docs in the `posts` directory
  type: grid # or default or table; each type has its own set of yaml options to include
  sort: "date desc" # can also sort on more than one field
  categories: true # allows you to sort posts by assigned categories 
```

5. **Add your listing page to your website navbar:** Update `_quarto.yml` with your new listing page to add it to your site's navbar:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# ~ parts of `_quarto.yml` omitted for brevity ~

website:
  navbar:
    title: myWebsiteTitle
    right:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: home
      - about.qmd
      - posts.qmd # add your posts.qmd file to your navbar!
```

6. **Preview or Render your website:** Make sure your listing page shows up by previewing or rendering your website. You should have something that looks like this:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/blog-added.png")
```

## IV. Add a blog post to your blog

Now that you have your listing page set up, we can start populating it with blog posts. Repeat the following steps each time you want to add a new post.

1. **Create a subdirectory *inside* your `posts` directory:** To stay organized, I usually name mine `YYYY-MM-DD-short-post-description`. This folder name will also become the [slug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Slug) for your published post.

2. **Inside your new subdirectory, create a new `.qmd` file called `index.qmd`.** The name here is important! It *must* be called `index.qmd`. Your file path should look something like this: `mywebsite/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/index.qmd`.

3. **Configure your blog post:** You can add a variety of different options to the YAML section of `index.qmd`. Here are my go-to options:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
---
title: "blog post title"

```

- You should include a *title*, but don't necessarily need a *description* (although I think they're nice to have!). Both of these fields will appear on your listing page.

- You can include more than one *author* -- see [this post](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-06-22-hello_quarto/) and [source code](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io/blob/main/posts/2022-06-22-hello_quarto/index.qmd) as an example.

- You may includes as many self-defined *categories* as you'd like. Make sure that your spelling/capitalization/punctuation is consistent across blog posts should you apply the same categories to multiple posts.

- Adding the *citation* option automatically generates a BibTeX citation and
