    "title": "Generalized Linear Mixed Models for Predictions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nTo meet the ever-growing demand for higher data rates, accurate channel models are needed for optimal design and deployment of mobile wireless networks. This work proposes a new method for addressing path loss modeling at 800 MHz of suburban environment based on ﬁeld measurements. Using generalized linear mixed models, we develop a new statistical model that accounts for the autocorrelation among measurements at the same distance at diﬀerent times. The proposed method allows linear, quadratic, and cubic relationship forms between the path loss measurements and the natural logarithm of the distance, which is almost unexplored as existing models use a straight line relationship. A comparison study consists of comparing nine propagation models in terms of the mean absolute prediction error. The new model performs over 30% better than the existing models for the considered measurements. We also show that a cubic relationship form between path loss measurements and the logarithm of distance could be more suitable than a straight line form for prediction purposes. The results show that the generalized linear mixed models signiﬁcantly improve the prediction power regardless of the form of the model (linear, quadratic, or cubic) (Cohen and Alqudah 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCohen, Achraf, and Yazan A Alqudah. 2023. “On the Application of Generalized Linear Mixed Models for Predicting Path Loss in LTE Networks.” EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing 2023 (1): 1–13."

    "text": "Overview\nProteomic patterns can help the diagnosis of the underlying pathological state of an organ such as the ovary, the lung, and the breast, to name few. An accurate classification of mass spectrometry is a crucial point to establish a reliable diagnosis and decision process regarding a type of cancer.\nA statistical methodology for classifying mass spectrometry data is proposed. An overview of wavelets, principal component analysis-T2 statistic, and support vector machines is given. The study is performed on low-mass SELDI spectra derived from patients with breast cancer and from normal controls. There are 156 samples where control (normal) patients contribute with 57 samples and 99 samples are cancer. A hyperparameter optimization is conducted to select a support vector machine classification model based on grid search. The performance was evaluated with a k-fold cross validation technique and Monte-Carlo simulation with 100 replications. The average accuracy is 100% with standard error equals to 0. The averages of the sensitivity and specificity are both equal to 100%, as well as the area under the curve. The excellent performance of the proposed method is mainly due to the modeling, the new PCA-T2 statistic combining details and approximation coefficients, and the feature extraction procedure proposed (Cohen, Messaoudi, and Badir 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCohen, Achraf, Chaimaa Messaoudi, and Hassan Badir. 2018. “A New Wavelet-Based Approach for Mass Spectrometry Data Classification.” New Frontiers of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, 175–89."

    "text": "On the use of Chi-square test and approximate the distribution: Small expected frequencies leads to poor approximation of the distribution of the chi-square statistic with the chi-square distribution. That is because when small frequencies are present, the possible values of the chi-square statistic are “much” discrete. Therefore, the continuous chi-square distribution becomes not a good fit.\nA general rule is to at least have 5 as the smallest frequency in your table, however this rule seems to be chosen at random (Cochran,1952). Yates proposed a correction (implemented in R).\nNowadays, given computing capabilities the correction is less needed. So what should we do?\nFisher’s exact test is a solid alternative but if your design allows the assumption of “fixed margins”. More over Fisher’s exact test can be used in larger tables than 2 x 2. If the expected frequencies are small (<5) then one can use the Monte Carlo simulated p-value."
