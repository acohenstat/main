# Overview

This study intended to explore possible variations among youth adjudicated
for sexual offenses based on personal criminogenic factors, offense, and
victim characteristics. Utilizing a data set collected from the juvenile
court files in Turkey (n=460), the Latent Class Analysis revealed that the
study sample included three different subgroups with distinct features:
“non-delinquent, peer victim-targeting,” “non-delinquent, younger victim targeting,” and “delinquent, versatile” youth adjudicated for sex offenses [@buker2022exploration].
