# Overview

This talk was originally developed for the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/), administered by the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) in partnership with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/).

It's since been given to students from UCSB's [Master of Technology Management Program](https://tmp.ucsb.edu/academics/master-technology-management) (Jan 2022), [R-Ladies St. Louis](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-st-louis/?_cookie-check=tJVp_VfFF4axweCV) (Feb 2022), and [The Brown School StatLab](https://gwbweb.wustl.edu/News/Pages/Brown-School-StatLab-offers-statistics-support.aspx) at the University of Washington in St. Louis (Mar 2022).

# Abstract

Googling for code help is something that all data scientists (at all career stages) do. But figuring out how to get the information you need back can be incredibly challenging, particularly for new coders. In this workshop, weâ€™ll discuss strategies for refining your queries to increase your chances of finding informative solutions.
