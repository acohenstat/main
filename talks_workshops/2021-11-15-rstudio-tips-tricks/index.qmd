# Overview

This talk was originally developed for the [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/), administered by the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) in partnership with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/).

# Abstract

As environmental data scientists, we spend a lot of time in RStudio. Taking some time to learn how you can customize your RStudio IDE (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment) and the keyboard shortcuts used to navigate around that IDE can make you a more efficient (and happier) hacker!
