## {{< fa chalkboard-teacher title="A teacher at a chalkboard" >}} the profession

I consider the vital goal of teaching to *encourage learning and foster new ideas*. Students take many of their learning habits from the professor. I believe that If I do not show interest in the subject and a passion for learning, students will less likely produce the effort to learn in the class. I believe that one way to foster learning is to demonstrate those feelings to my students. I also emphasize the interconnection among concepts, which helps students to apprehend new topics.

I focus on developing and delivering data science and statistics classes. I teach online and in-person. I believe in continuous improvement in teaching and mentoring. Live-coding is a unique teaching style that is invaluable to the development of future statistician and data scientists. Active learning is essential to students and group work to gain confidence and skills. I am always looking for new ways to make my teaching style and materials more approachable and inclusive.
